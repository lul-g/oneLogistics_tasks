[x] name page without using title
[-] remove title component
## OLN
[x] removed the whole footer that contains 'powered by' code:
	```
	<footer class='container_wrap socket_color' id='socket' <?php avia_markup_helper( array( 'context' => 'footer' ) ); ?>>
		<span class='copyright'><?php echo $copyright . $kriesi_at_backlink; ?></span>                    
		<!-- ####### END SOCKET CONTAINER ####### -->
	</footer>
	```
	
[x] added css code into php 
 ` to move the 'to-top' button upward so that its not covered by the chatbox`
 ` to change border radius so that its a circle.`
 > to-top btn position looks awkward until the chatbox loads. Once it loads its perfect.

[-] there are errors that need to be fixed.
 `Otherwise the theme customize option does not work
The changes I made are not the cause of the errors. They were there when I started working on it.`

```I have multiple questions on this part so I will either compile a list of questions by the end of the day or I can meet with you tomorrow. Let me know which one works for you ```
